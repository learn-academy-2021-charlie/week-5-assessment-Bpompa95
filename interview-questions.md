2. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: From what i know about RD that Relational database includes tables containing rows and columns. Also, from what i learn while resarching that RB (Relational Databases) are also called Relational Database Management Systems.

3. What is object-relational mapping?

  Your answer: From what i learn in class ORM (object-relational mapping) is a tool that allows us to write SQL queries using rails. and i know Object part is the one you use with your programming language, Relational part is a Relational Database Manager System and finally the Mapping part is where you do a bridge between your objects and your tables that is how i think of ORM (object-relational mapping)

  Researched answer: object-relational mapping is very important becuase it allows ruby to call methods and recives information from the object. this is what intrest me that they're a lot of different type of ORM languages and it is Django ORM, Dapper ORM, JOOQ ORM and  SQL Alchemy.



4. What is a gem?

  Your answer: i don't know much about it i need to do more reserach in it but what i know from class gems package up Ruby code so it is easy to share with others. I also remember gem is like a library that can be installed in your server in projects.

  Researched answer: so i reserached more about gem and what i've learned online that each gem has a name, version and plateform and ruby was first appered in 1995 and the developer who designed was Yukihiro Matsumoto and gem was appeared in 2003 honestly i thought that was really cool.
